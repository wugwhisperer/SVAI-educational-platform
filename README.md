# SVAI-educational-platform
Piloting AI-Computational Biology educational platform on gitbook to increase interpretability of scientific and technical work done at SVAI research events and promote relevant technologies for future research. We hope to convert this into a major educational resource to catalyze more penetrative results for future SVAI research.

## What's the purpose of this platform?
This scientific and technical educational platform aims to improve the transparency, interpretability, and effectiveness of the community research done at SVAI.
We're trying to achieve this goal tackling four major bottlenecks in doing the research:

1. Understanding the Data
2. Working on the Cloud
3. Understanding the biological aspect of the research
4. Understanding the artificial intelligence aspect of the research


By trying to provide resources to tackle these major bottlenecks, we can then effectively deep dive into illuminating relevant tools and approaches. The hope is then that with the help of your talented mind collaborating with other talented minds in this community, we creatively repurpose and utilize these relevant tools and approaches to tackle any of these three major areas of research (relevant to the patient):

- patient categorization
- fundamental biological processes underlying human diseases
- treating, or developing new treatments.

**Soon to be released! Platform is powered by gitbook.**
